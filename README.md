# ESPHome code for the Waveshare esp32-s3 7-inch

ESPHome code to use for your Waveshare-ESPHome-LVGL-tinkering.

## My project

<img src="images\example_v2.png" alt="overview" width="80%"/>

Only one page, nothing fancy, but examples with this board and ESPHome together with LVGL are scarse and far apart, so I thought I would share my project. 

## ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7
https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-lcd-7.htm

ESP32-S3 7inch Capacitive Touch Display Development Board, ESP32 With Display, 800Ã—480, 5-point Touch, 32-bit LX7 Dual-core Processor, Up to 240MHz Frequency, Supports WiFi & Bluetooth, With Onboard Antenna

## Code
Complete example **[waveshare-esp32-s3-7inch_v2.yaml](waveshare-esp32-s3-7inch.yaml)**
Probably not nearly as optimal as you could do, but it seems to do the job as indented.
